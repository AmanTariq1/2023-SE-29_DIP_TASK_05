Image Filtering and Noise Reduction (Task 05)

This Python program demonstrates image noise reduction using multiple filtering techniques on a user-uploaded grayscale image. It applies the Median Filter to remove impulsive "salt and pepper" noise while preserving edges, the Mode Filter to replace each pixel with the most frequent neighboring value, and the Gaussian Filter to smooth the image by reducing high-frequency noise. The program displays the original image alongside all filtered versions for visual comparison, highlighting the differences in edge preservation, noise removal, and blurring effects. This allows users to analyze and select the most appropriate filter based on the type of noise and desired output.

Libraries: PIL (Pillow), NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
